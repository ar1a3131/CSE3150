# Perfect Integer Checker

## Introduction
This C++ program checks whether an integer is a perfect number. A perfect integer is the sum of all of its divisors, excluding itself. For example, 6 = 3 + 2 + 1, so 6 is a perfect number. Likewise, 28 is a perfect number.

## Files
- `perfect_integer.h` and `perfect_integer.cpp`: Contains the implementation of functions to check if an integer is perfect and to check a vector of integers for perfect numbers.
- `main.cpp`: Contains the main function where the program demonstrates the usage of the perfect integer checker.
- `test.cpp`: Contains unit tests for the perfect integer checker functions.

## Compiling and Running
To compile the program, you can use the following commands:

'''
g++ -o main main.cpp perfect_integer.cpp
./main
'''
